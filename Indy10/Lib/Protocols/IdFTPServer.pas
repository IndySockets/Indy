  Rev 1.146    3/23/2005 5:16:56 AM  JPMugaas
  Should compile.

  Rev 1.145    3/14/05 11:28:50 AM  RLebeau
  Bug fix for CommandSIZE() not checking the FTPFileSystem property.

  Updated to reflect changes in TIdReply.NumericCode handling.

  Rev 1.144    3/5/2005 3:33:58 PM  JPMugaas
  Fix for some compiler warnings having to do with TStream.Read being platform
  specific.  This was fixed by changing the Compressor API to use TIdStreamVCL
  instead of TStream.  I also made appropriate adjustments to other units for
  this.

  Rev 1.143    11/22/2004 8:29:20 PM  JPMugaas
  Fix for a compiler warning.

  Rev 1.142    11/22/2004 7:49:36 PM  JPMugaas
  You now can access help before you are logged in.   This is done to conform
  to RFC 959.

  Rev 1.141    2004.10.27 9:17:48 AM  czhower
  For TIdStrings

  Rev 1.140    10/26/2004 9:40:42 PM  JPMugaas
  Updated ref.

    Rev 1.139    9/15/2004 5:01:00 PM  DSiders
  Added localization comments.

  Rev 1.138    2004.08.13 11:03:22  czhower
  Removed unused var.

  Rev 1.137    7/29/2004 1:33:10 AM  JPMugaas
  Reordered AUTH command values for a new property under development.  This
  should make things more logical.

    Rev 1.136    7/18/2004 3:00:42 PM  DSiders
  Added localization comments.

  Rev 1.135    7/15/2004 1:33:00 AM  JPMugaas
  Bug fix for error 105.   I fixed this by changing data channel command
  processing.  If the command is not ABOR or STAT, the command is put into a
  FIFO queue.  After the data channel operation is completed, the commands from
  the FIFO queue are processed.    I have tested FlashFXP 3.0 RC4 and it does
  worki as expected.  The behavior is also the same as what NcFTPD does with a
  NOOP being sent during a data transfer.

  This may also help with FTP command pipelining as proposed by:
  http://cr.yp.to/ftp/pipelining.html

  Note that we can not use the regular command handler framework for  data
  channel commands because STAT and ABOR need to be handled IMMEDIATELY.

  Rev 1.134    7/13/04 9:08:10 PM  RLebeau
  Renamed OnPASV event to OnPASVBeforeBind and added new OnPASVReply event

  Rev 1.133    7/13/04 8:13:56 PM  RLebeau
  Various changed for DefaultDataPort handling

  Rev 1.132    7/13/2004 3:34:12 AM  JPMugaas
  CCC command and a few other minor modifications to comply with
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-murray-auth-ftp-ssl-14.txt .

  I also fixed a few minor bugs in the help and a problem with some error
  replies sending an extra 200 after a 5xxx code messing up some clients.

  I also expanded the Security options to selectively disable CCC per user.
  Some administrators may want to do this for security reasons.

  Rev 1.131    7/12/2004 11:46:44 PM  JPMugaas
  Improvement in OPTS MODE Z handling.  It will give an error if there's only
  one param.  Params must be in pairs.  If no valid parameters are present, we
  give an error.

  Rev 1.130    07/07/2004 17:34:38  ANeillans
  Corrected compile bug.
  Line 6026,
            if PosInStrArray(IntToStr(LNoVal),STATES,False)>-1 then
  Function expected a string, not an integer.

    Rev 1.129    7/6/2004 4:52:16 PM  DSiders
  Corrected spelling of Challenge in properties, methods, types.

  Rev 1.128    6/29/2004 4:09:04 PM  JPMugaas
  OPTS MODE Z now supported as per draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-02.txt.  This
  should keep FTP Voyager 11 happy.

  Rev 1.127    6/28/2004 7:23:20 PM  JPMugaas
  Bugfix.  An invalid site command would cause no reply to be given.  Now a
  syntax is given in such cases.

  Rev 1.126    6/27/2004 1:45:30 AM  JPMugaas
  Can now optionally support LastAccessTime like Smartftp's FTP Server could.
  I also made the MLST listing object and parser support this as well.

  Rev 1.125    6/17/2004 3:56:28 PM  JPMugaas
  Fix for AV that happens after data channel operation.

  Rev 1.124    6/16/2004 2:29:32 PM  JPMugaas
  Removed direct access to a FConnection.  We now use the Connection property
  in the TIdContext.

  Rev 1.123    6/12/2004 9:05:52 AM  JPMugaas
  Telnet control sequences should now work during a data transfer.
  Removed HandleTelnetSequences.  It was part of a crude workaround which had
  never works and the matter was fixed in another way.
  OnCustomDir should now work if the DirStyle is custom.

    Rev 1.122    6/11/2004 9:35:12 AM  DSiders
  Added "Do not Localize" comments.

  Rev 1.121    2004.05.20 11:37:26 AM  czhower
  IdStreamVCL

  Rev 1.120    5/16/04 5:30:26 PM  RLebeau
  Added setter methods to the ReplyUnknownSITECommand and SITECommands
  properties

  Added GetRepliesClass() overrides

  Rev 1.119    5/1/2004 1:52:20 PM  JPMugaas
  Updated for PeekBytes API change.

  Rev 1.118    4/8/2004 12:19:08 PM  JPMugaas
  Should work with new code.

  Rev 1.117    3/3/2004 6:34:46 PM  JPMugaas
  Improved help system.
  Some manditory (RFC 1123 were rutning syntax errors instead of not
  implemented.
  Add some mention of some other RFC 2228 commands for completness.  Not that
  there are not supported or implemented.

  Rev 1.116    3/3/2004 6:02:14 AM  JPMugaas
  Command descriptions.

  Rev 1.115    3/2/2004 8:13:28 AM  JPMugaas
  Fixup for minor API change.

  Rev 1.113    3/1/2004 12:41:40 PM  JPMugaas
  Should compile with new code.

  Rev 1.112    2/29/2004 6:02:38 PM  JPMugaas
  Improved bug fix for problem with Telnet sequences not being handled properly
  in the FTP server.  Litteral CR and LF are now handled properly (according to
  the Telnet Specification).

  Rev 1.111    2/25/2004 3:27:04 PM  JPMugaas
  STAT -l now works like a LIST command except that it returns output on the
  control channel.  This is for consistancy with microsoft FTP Service,
  RaidenFTPD, and a few other servers.  FlashFXP can take advantage of this
  feature as well to gain some efficiency.  Note that I do not do not advocate
  doing this on the FTP client because some servers will act differently than
  you would assume.  I may see about possible options for using STAT -l but I
  can NOT promise anything.

  Rev 1.110    2/17/2004 6:37:28 PM  JPMugaas
  OnPASV event added for people needing to change the IP address or port value
  in commands such as PASV.  This should only be done if you have a compelling
  reason to do it.

  Note that the IP address parameter can NOT work with EPSV and SPSV because
  only the port number is returned.  The IP address is presumed to be the same
  one that the host is connecting to.

  Rev 1.109    2/17/2004 12:26:06 PM  JPMugaas
  The client now supports MODE Z (deflate) uploads and downloads as specified
  by http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-00.txt

  Rev 1.108    2/15/2004 12:11:04 AM  JPMugaas
  SPSV support.  SPSV is an old propoal to help FTP support IPv6.  This was
  mentioned at:  http://cr.yp.to/ftp/retr.html and is supported by PureFTPD.

  Rev 1.107    2/14/2004 10:00:40 PM  JPMugaas
  Both upload and download should now work in MODE Z.  Dir already worked
  properly.

  Rev 1.106    2/12/2004 11:34:38 PM  JPMugaas
  FTP Deflate preliminary support.  Work still needs to be done for upload and
  downloading.

  Rev 1.105    2004.02.08 3:08:10 PM  czhower
  .Net fix.

  Rev 1.104    2004.02.07 5:03:10 PM  czhower
  .net fixes.

  Rev 1.103    2004.02.03 5:45:54 PM  czhower
  Name changes

  Rev 1.102    1/29/2004 3:15:52 PM  JPMugaas
  Fix for P@SW in InitCommandHandlers used "PASV" isntead of "P@SW".  Fixed.

  Rev 1.101    1/22/2004 8:29:06 AM  JPMugaas
  Removed Ansi*.

  Rev 1.100    1/21/2004 2:34:38 PM  JPMugaas
  Fixed SITE ZONE reply.
  InitComponent

  Rev 1.99    1/19/2004 4:37:02 AM  JPMugaas
  MinutesFromGMT was moved to IdFTPCommon because the client now uses it.

  Rev 1.98    1/18/2004 9:19:08 AM  JPMugaas
  P@SW now supported.

  This is necessary as some routers that replace a PASV with a P@SW
  as part of a misguided attempt to add a feature.
  A router would do a replacement so a client would think that
  PASV wasn't supported and then the client would do a PORT command
  instead.  That doesn't happen so this just caused the client not to work.

  See:  http://www.gbnetwork.co.uk/smcftpd/

  Rev 1.97    1/17/2004 7:40:08 PM  JPMugaas
  MLSD added to FEAT list for consistancy with other FTP servers.
  Fixed bug that would cause FXP transfers to fail when receiving a PASV.

  Rev 1.96    1/16/2004 12:25:06 AM  JPMugaas
  Fixes for MTDM set modified time.

  Rev 1.94    1/15/2004 2:36:50 AM  JPMugaas
  XMD5 command support.
  SITE ZONE command added for FTP Voyager.
  Minor adjustment in AUTH line in the FEAT response to indicate that we
  support the AUTH TLS, AUTH TLS-C, AUTH SSL, and AUTH TLS-P explicit TLS
  commands.

  Rev 1.93    1/14/2004 4:11:30 PM  JPMugaas
  CPSV support added.  This is like PASV but indicates that we use ssl_connect
  instead of ssl_accept.  CPSV is used in FlashFXP for secure site-to-site file
  transfers.

  Rev 1.92    1/14/2004 12:24:06 PM  JPMugaas
  SSCN Support for secure Site to Site Transfers using SSL.

  SSCN is defined at:

  http://www.raidenftpd.com/kb/kb000000037.htm

  Rev 1.91    1/13/2004 6:30:38 AM  JPMugaas
  Numerous bug fixes.
  Now supports XCWD (a predicessor to CWD).
  Command Reply for unknown command works again.
  Started putting some formatting into common routines.
  CuteFTP goes bonkers with a "215 " reply to SYST command.  Now indicate that
  SYST isn't implemented instead of giving that "215 ".  Note that a
  "CustomSystID" should be provided when DirFormat is ftpdfCustom.
  If DirFormat is ftpdfCustom and OnListDirectory is provided; MLST, MLSD, and
  OPTS MLSD will be DISABLED.  OnListDirectory is used in the custom format for
  structed standardized output with the MLSD and MLST commands.
  A not implemented is now given for some commands.

  Rev 1.90    1/5/2004 11:53:00 PM  JPMugaas
  Some messages moved to resource strings.  Minor tweeks.  EIdException no
  longer raised.

  Rev 1.88    1/4/2004 3:51:32 PM  JPMugaas
  Fixed a CWD bug.  The parameter was being ignored.

  Rev 1.87    1/3/2004 8:05:18 PM  JPMugaas
  Bug fix:  Sometimes, replies will appear twice due to the way functionality
  was enherited.

  Rev 1.86    1/3/2004 5:37:56 PM  JPMugaas
  Changes from Bas:

  added function GetReplyClass, this function returns the class of reply this
  server class uses, this is because in dotnet there can be no code before the
  inherited in the constructor ( that is used mow to determine the reply class )
   
  changed System.Delete to IdDelete (in coreglobal) because System.Delete is
  not in dotnet
   
  SplitLines is not enabled in dotnet yet, so i made it a todo, make sure to
  enable it and remove the todo if you check it in 
   

  Rev 1.85    1/2/2004 1:02:08 AM  JPMugaas
  Made comment about why the SYST descriptor is determined the way it is.

  Rev 1.84    1/2/2004 12:55:32 AM  JPMugaas
  Now compiles.  Removed the EmulateSystem property.  Replaced one part with
  the DirFormat property.

  Rev 1.83    1/1/2004 10:55:10 PM  JPMugaas
  Remy Lebeau found a bug with path processing in the FTP server.  I was
  passing an emptry Result string instead of APath in FTPNormalize.

  Rev 1.77    10/11/2003 10:17:28 AM  JPMugaas
  Checked in a more recent version which  should be worked on instead.

  Rev 1.75    9/19/2003 12:50:18 PM  JPMugaas
  Started attempt to get the server to compile.

  Rev 1.74    9/18/2003 10:20:06 AM  JPMugaas
  Updated for new API.

  Rev 1.73    8/24/2003 06:50:02 PM  JPMugaas
  API Change in the FileSystem component so that a thread is passed instead of
  some data from the thread.  This should also make the API's easier to manage
  than before and provide more flexibility for developers writing their own
  file system components.

  Rev 1.72    7/13/2003 7:56:00 PM  SPerry
  fixed problem with commandhandlers

  Rev 1.69    6/17/2003 09:30:20 PM  JPMugaas
  Fixed an AV with the ALLO command if no parameters were passed.  Stated in
  HELP command that we don't support some old FTP E-Mail commands from RFC 765
  which have not been in use for many years.  We now give a reply saying those
  aren't implemented to be consistant with some Unix FTP deamons.

  Rev 1.68    6/17/2003 03:16:36 PM  JPMugaas
  I redid the help and site help implementations so that they list commands.
  It did mean loosing the FHelpText TIdStrings property but this should be more
  consistant with common practices.

  Rev 1.67    6/17/2003 09:07:40 AM  JPMugaas
  Improved SITE HELP handling.

  Rev 1.65    5/26/2003 12:22:50 PM  JPMugaas

  Rev 1.64    5/25/2003 03:54:28 AM  JPMugaas

    Rev 1.63    5/21/2003 3:59:32 PM  BGooijen
  removed with in InitializeCommandHandlers, and changed exception replies

  Rev 1.62    5/21/2003 09:29:40 AM  JPMugaas

  Rev 1.61    5/19/2003 08:11:44 PM  JPMugaas
  Now should compile properly with new code in Core.

  Rev 1.60    4/10/2003 02:54:14 PM  JPMugaas
  Improvement for FTP STOU command.  Unique filename now uses
  IdGlobal.GetUniqueFileName instead of Rand.  I also fixed GetUniqueFileName
  so that it can accept an empty path specification.

    Rev 1.59    3/30/2003 12:18:38 AM  BGooijen
  bug fix + ssl one data channel fixed

    Rev 1.58    3/24/2003 11:08:42 PM  BGooijen
  'transfer'-commands now block, until the transfer is done/aborted.
  this made it possible to send the reply after the transfer in the
  control-thread

  Rev 1.57    3/16/2003 06:11:18 PM  JPMugaas
  Server now derrives from a TLS framework.

  Rev 1.56    3/14/2003 11:33:46 PM  JPMugaas

    Rev 1.55    3/14/2003 10:44:38 PM  BGooijen
  Removed warnings, changed StartSSL to PassThrough:=false;

    Rev 1.54    3/14/2003 10:00:24 PM  BGooijen
  Removed TIdServerIOHandlerSSLBase.PeerPassthrough, the ssl is now enabled in
  the server-protocol-files

  Rev 1.53    3/13/2003 05:21:18 PM  JPMugaas
  Bas's bug fix.  There was a wrong typecast.

    Rev 1.52    3/13/2003 8:57:30 PM  BGooijen
  changed TIdSSLIOHandlerSocketBase to TIdIOHandlerSocket in
  TIdDataChannelContext.SetupDataChannel

  Rev 1.51    3/13/2003 09:49:06 AM  JPMugaas
  Now uses an abstract SSL base class instead of OpenSSL so 3rd-party vendors
  can plug-in their products.

  Rev 1.50    3/13/2003 06:11:54 AM  JPMugaas
  Updated with Bas's change.

  Rev 1.49    3/10/2003 09:12:46 PM  JPMugaas
  Most command handlers now use Do methods for consistancy with other Indy code.

  Rev 1.48    3/10/2003 05:09:22 PM  JPMugaas
  MLST now works as expected with the file system.  Note that the MLST means
  simply to give information about an item instead of its contents.
  GetRealFileName in IdFTPFileSystem now can accept the wildcard *.
  When doing dirs in EPLF, only information about a directory is retruned if it
  is specified.

  Rev 1.47    3/9/2003 02:11:34 PM  JPMugaas
  Removed server support for MODE B and MODE C.  It turns out that we do not
  support those modes properly.  We only implemented Stream mode.  We now
  simply return a 504 for modes we don't support instead of a 200 okay.  This
  was throwing off Opera 7.02.

  Rev 1.46    3/6/2003 11:00:12 AM  JPMugaas
  Now handles the MFMT command and the MFCT (Modified Date fact) command.

  Rev 1.45    3/6/2003 08:26:28 AM  JPMugaas
  Bug fixes.

  FTP COMB command can now work in the FTPFileSystem component.

  MD5, MMD5, and XCRC are now supported in the Virtual File System.

  Rev 1.43    3/5/2003 11:46:38 AM  JPMugaas
  Rename now works in Virtual FileSystem.

  Rev 1.42    3/2/2003 04:54:34 PM  JPMugaas
  Now does recursive dir lists with the Virtual File System layer as well as
  honors other switches.

  Rev 1.41    3/2/2003 02:18:32 PM  JPMugaas
  Bug fix for where a reply was not returned when using a file system component.

  Rev 1.40    3/2/2003 02:23:38 AM  JPMugaas
  fix for problem with pathes in the virtual file system.

  Rev 1.39    2/24/2003 08:50:44 PM  JPMugaas

  Rev 1.38    2/24/2003 07:56:22 PM  JPMugaas
  Now uses /bin/ls strings.

  Rev 1.37    2/24/2003 07:21:10 AM  JPMugaas
  FTP Server now strips out any -R switches when emulating EPLF servers.
  Recursive lists aren't supported with EPLF.

  Rev 1.36    2/21/2003 06:54:10 PM  JPMugaas
  The FTP list processing has been restructured so that Directory output is not
  done by IdFTPList.  This now also uses the IdFTPListParserBase for parsing so
  that the code is more scalable.

  Rev 1.35    2/15/2003 10:29:42 AM  JPMugaas
  Added support for some Unix specific facts with MLSD and MLST.

  Rev 1.34    2/14/2003 05:42:08 PM  JPMugaas
  Moved everything from IdFTPUtils to IdFTPCommon at Kudzu's suggestion.

  Rev 1.33    2/14/2003 11:57:48 AM  JPMugaas
  Updated for new API.  Made sure that there were no calls to a function we
  removed.

  Rev 1.32    2/14/2003 10:45:18 AM  JPMugaas
  Updated for minor API change.

  Rev 1.30    2/13/2003 01:28:08 AM  JPMugaas
  MLSD and MLST should now work better.

  Rev 1.29    2/12/2003 12:30:56 PM  JPMugaas
  Now honors parameters with the NLIST command.

    Rev 1.28    2/5/2003 10:30:04 PM  BGooijen
  Re-enabled ssl-support

  Rev 1.27    2/4/2003 05:31:40 PM  JPMugaas
  Added ASwitches parameter to the ListEvent so we can pass parameters such as
  "-R" in addition to the standard path.

  Rev 1.26    2/3/2003 11:01:50 AM  JPMugaas
  Moved list export to IdFTPList.

  Rev 1.25    1/31/2003 01:59:18 PM  JPMugaas
  Security options are now reenabled.

  Rev 1.24    1/31/2003 01:19:00 PM  JPMugaas
  Now passes the ControlConnection context instead of the ControlConnection
  object itself.

  Rev 1.23    1/31/2003 06:34:52 AM  JPMugaas
  Now SYST command works as expected.

  Rev 1.22    1/31/2003 04:23:24 AM  JPMugaas
  FTP Server security options can be set for individual users and the server
  will now use the Context's security options.  THis should permit more
  flexibility in security.

  Rev 1.21    1/30/2003 03:31:06 AM  JPMugaas
  Now should also properly handle exceptions in the MLSx commands.

  Rev 1.20    1/30/2003 02:55:26 AM  JPMugaas
  Now properly handles exceptions in the ListEvent for the STAT and LIST
  commands.

  Rev 1.19    1/29/2003 01:17:18 AM  JPMugaas
  Exception handling should mostly work as it should.  There's still a problem
  with the list.

  Rev 1.18    1/28/2003 02:27:26 AM  JPMugaas
  Improved exception handling in several events to try to be more consistant.
  Now can optionally hide the exception message when giving an error reply to
  the user.  This should prevent some inadvertant information about a computer
  going to a troublemaker.

  Rev 1.17    1/27/2003 05:03:16 AM  JPMugaas
  Now a developer can provide status information to a user with the STAT
  command if they want.  We format the reply in a standard manner for them.
  They just provide the information.

  Rev 1.16    1/27/2003 02:13:30 AM  JPMugaas
  Added more security options as suggested by:
  http://www.sans.org/rr/infowar/fingerprint.php to help slow down an attack.
  You can optionally disable both SYST and the STAT commands.  Trouble makers
  can use those to help determine server type and then use known flaws to
  compromise it.  Note that these do not completely prevent attacks and should
  not lull administrators into a false sense of security.

  Rev 1.15    1/27/2003 12:32:08 AM  JPMugaas
  Now can optionally return the identifier for the real operating system.  By
  default, this property is false for security reasons.

  Rev 1.14    1/26/2003 11:59:16 PM  JPMugaas
  SystemDescriptor behavior change as well as SYST command change.
  SystemDescriptor no longer needs an OS type as the first word.  That is now
  handled by the SYST commandhandler to better comply with RFC 959.

  Rev 1.13    1/25/2003 02:00:58 AM  JPMugaas
  MMD5 (for multiple MD5 checksums) is now supported.
  Refined MD5 command support slgihtly.

  This is based on:
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-twine-ftpmd5-00.txt

    Rev 1.12    1/24/2003 6:07:24 PM  BGooijen
  Changed TIdDataChannelThread to TIdDataChannelContext

    Rev 1.11    1/23/2003 9:06:26 PM  BGooijen
  changed the CommandAbor

    Rev 1.10    1/23/2003 10:39:38 AM  BGooijen
  TIdDataChannelContext.FServer was never assigned

    Rev 1.9    1/20/2003 1:15:40 PM  BGooijen
  Changed to TIdTCPServer / TIdCmdTCPServer classes

  Rev 1.8    1/17/2003 06:21:02 PM  JPMugaas
  Now works with new design.

  Rev 1.7    1/17/2003 05:28:42 PM  JPMugaas

  Rev 1.6    1-9-2003 14:45:30  BGooijen
  Added ABOR command with telnet escape characters
  Fixed hanging of ABOR command
  STOR and STOU now use REST-position
  ABOR now returns 226 instead of 200

  Rev 1.5    1-9-2003 14:35:52  BGooijen
  changed TIdFTPServerContext(ASender.Context.Thread) to
  TIdFTPServerContext(ASender.Context) on some places

  Rev 1.4    1/9/2003 06:08:10 AM  JPMugaas
  Updated to be based on IdContext.

  Rev 1.3    1-1-2003 20:13:06  BGooijen
  Changed to support the new TIdContext class

  Rev 1.2    12-15-2002 21:15:46  BGooijen
  IFDEF-ed all SSL code, the IFDEF-s are removed as soon as the SSL works again.

  Rev 1.1    11/14/2002 02:55:58 PM  JPMugaas
  FEAT and MLST now completely use the RFC Reply objects instead of
  Connection.WriteLn.  The Connection.WriteLn was a workaround for a deficit in
  the original RFC Reply object.  The workaround is no longer needed.

{
I know that this code and design are a mess.

There are actually two forms of MDTM and they mean different things.

The formal spec indicates that anything after the space in MDTM <filename>
is the filename.

FTP Voyager and some other clients abuse the MDTM command by using it to specify
a timestamp for the "Modified Time" on a file.  The format is like this:

 MDTM YYYYMMDDHHMMSS filename

 Thus, there's an ambiguity.

 Does MDTM 20031229152022 ESBAdDemo.exe  mean
   1) Set the date time on ESBAdDemo.exe to 12/29/2003 3:20:22 PM

   or

   2) Get the time for a file named 20031229152022 ESBAdDemo.exe

 To resolve this ambiguity, we check specifically for a valid date, and then see
  if a file, 20031229152022 ESBAdDemo.exe really does exist.  If not, we interpret
  MDTM as a set date command.  Otherwise, we will traat it as a request for the timestamp
  of a file, 20031229152022 ESBAdDemo.exe.

  Note also that the time is sometimes given as either relative to the local server
  or an offset is provided.

  Note from:
  http://www.ftpvoyager.com/releasenotes.asp
  ====
  Added support for RFC change and the MDTM. MDTM requires sending the server
  GMT (UTC) instead of a "fixed" date and time. FTP Voyager supports this with
  Serv-U automatically by checking the Serv-U version number and by checking the
  response to the FEAT command for MDTM. Servers returning "MDTM" or
  "MDTM YYYYMMDDHHMMSS[+-TZ] filename" will use the old method. Servers
  returning "MDTM YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" only will use the new method where the date a
  and time is GMT (UTC).
  ===
  We will use the old form for compatiability with some older FTP Voyager clients
  and because a few servers support the old form as well.  I do this even though,
  this is really inconsistant with what MDTM returns for a query request.  I might
  consider some type of support for the new form but I do not feel that such
  things are just abuse of the MDTM command.  That's why I prefer a separate command for
  modifying file modification dates (MFMT).

where the first date is the "Last Access Time"
the second date is the "Last Modified Time"
and the final date is the "Creation File Time"

I think the third parameter is optional.

The final parameter is "UTC"

gFTP does something different.  It does something like:

where the timestamp is probably in based on the local time.

Microsoft IIS accepts both a "/" and a "\" as path/file name separators.
We have to flatten this out so that our FTP server can behave like Microsoft IIS.

In Unix, a "\" is a valid filename character so we don't anything there.

This WILL cause a "\" to be treated differently in Unix and Win32.  I submit that
this is really desirable as both file systems are like apples and oranges.

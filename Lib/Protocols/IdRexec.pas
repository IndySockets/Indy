  Rev 1.0    11/13/2002 07:59:46 AM  JPMugaas

  -2001.05.18 - J. Peter Mugaas
  I removed the property for forcing client ports
  into a specific range.  This was not necessary
  for Rexec.  It is required for the TIdRSH Component

  -2001.02.15 - J. Peter Mugaas
  I moved most of the Rexec code to
  TIdRemoteCMDClient and TIdRexec now inherits
  from that class.  This change was necessary to
  reduce duplicate code with a new addition, IdRSH.

  -2001.02.14 - J. Peter Mugaas
  Made it more complient with Rexec servers
  and handled the #0 or error indicator

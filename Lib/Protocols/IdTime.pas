  Rev 1.10    2/10/2005 2:24:42 PM  JPMugaas
  Minor Restructures for some new UnixTime Service components.

  Rev 1.9    2004.02.03 5:44:34 PM  czhower
  Name changes

  Rev 1.8    1/21/2004 4:20:56 PM  JPMugaas
  InitComponent

  Rev 1.7    1/3/2004 1:00:00 PM  JPMugaas
  These should now compile with Kudzu's change in IdCoreGlobal.

  Rev 1.6    4/11/2003 02:45:44 PM  JPMugaas

  Rev 1.5    4/5/2003 7:23:56 PM  BGooijen
  Raises exception on timeout now

  Rev 1.4    4/4/2003 8:02:34 PM  BGooijen
  made host published

  Rev 1.3    2/24/2003 10:37:00 PM  JPMugaas
  Should compile.  TODO:  Figure out what to do with TIdTime and the timeout
  feature.

  Rev 1.2    12/7/2002 06:43:38 PM  JPMugaas
  These should now compile except for Socks server.  IPVersion has to be a
  property someplace for that.

  Rev 1.1    12/6/2002 05:30:48 PM  JPMugaas
  Now descend from TIdTCPClientCustom instead of TIdTCPClient.

  Rev 1.0    11/13/2002 08:03:14 AM  JPMugaas

{
 2001-Sep -21 J. Peter Mugaas
  - adjusted formula as suggested by Vaclav Korecek.  The old
  one would give wrong date, time if RoundTripDelay was over
   a value of 1000
 2000-May -04  J. Peter Mugaas
  -Changed RoundTripDelay to a cardinal and I now use the
   GetTickCount function for more accuracy
  -The formula had to adjusted for this.
 2000-May -03  J. Peter Mugaas
  -Added BaseDate to the date the calculations are based on can be
   adjusted to work after the year 2035
 2000-Apr.-29  J. Peter Mugaas
  -Made the time more accurate by taking into account time-zone
   bias by subtracting IdGlobal.TimeZoneBias.
  -I also added a correction for the time it took to receive the
   Integer from the server ( ReadInteger )
  -Changed Time property to DateTime and TimeCard to DateTimeCard
   to be more consistant with TIdSNTP.

  For all the constants except RSBindingFormCaption, there may be an
  & symbol before a letter or number.  This is rendered as that character being
  underlined.  In addition, the character after the & symbol along with the ALT
  key enables a user to move to that control.  Since these are on one form, be
  careful to ensure that the same letter or number does not have a & before it
  in more than one string, otherwise an ALT key sequence will be broken.

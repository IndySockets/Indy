  Rev 1.2    6/11/2004 8:40:10 AM  DSiders
  Added "Do not Localize" comments.

  Rev 1.1    2004.02.09 9:16:54 PM  czhower
  Updated to compile and match lib changes.

  Rev 1.0    2004.02.03 12:39:08 AM  czhower
  Move

  Rev 1.17    2003.10.19 2:50:42 PM  czhower
  Fiber cleanup

  Rev 1.16    2003.10.11 5:44:02 PM  czhower
  Chained servers now functional.

  Rev 1.15    2003.07.17 4:42:06 PM  czhower
  More IOCP improvements.

  Rev 1.14    2003.07.17 3:55:18 PM  czhower
  Removed IdIOChainEngineIOCP and merged it into TIdChaingEngine in
  IdIOHandlerChain.pas.

  Rev 1.10    2003.07.14 12:54:32 AM  czhower
  Fixed graceful close detection if it occurs after connect.

  Rev 1.9    2003.07.10 7:40:24 PM  czhower
  Comments

  Rev 1.8    7/5/2003 11:47:12 PM  BGooijen
  Added TIdWorkOpUnitCheckForDisconnect and TIdWorkOpUnitWriteFile

  Rev 1.7    4/23/2003 8:22:20 PM  BGooijen

  Rev 1.6    2003.04.22 9:48:50 PM  czhower

  Rev 1.5    2003.04.20 9:12:20 PM  czhower

  Rev 1.5    2003.04.19 3:14:14 PM  czhower

  Rev 1.4    2003.04.17 7:45:02 PM  czhower

  Rev 1.2    3/27/2003 2:43:04 PM  BGooijen
  Added woWriteStream and woWriteBuffer

  Rev 1.1    3/2/2003 12:36:24 AM  BGooijen
  Added woReadBuffer and TIdWorkOpUnitReadBuffer to read a buffer. Now
  ReadBuffer doesn't use ReadStream any more.
  TIdIOHandlerChain.ReadLn now supports MaxLineLength (splitting, and
  exceptions).
  woReadLn doesn't check the intire buffer any more, but continued where it
  stopped the last time.
  Added basic support for timeouts (probably only on read operations, and maybe
  connect), accuratie of timeout is currently 500msec.

  Rev 1.0    2/25/2003 10:45:46 PM  BGooijen
  Opcode files, some of these were in IdIOHandlerChain.pas

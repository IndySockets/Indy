# What is this?

Indy Direct is a complex networking component pack for Delphi and Lazarus programming enviroment,
 written in Pascal language.  
  
Delphi comes with it by default, but you should upgrade it, to get latest fixes.  
  
# DLLs:
  
The necessary binary DLL files can be [downloaded from here...](https://github.com/IndySockets/OpenSSL-Binaries)  
 _(But you never know, which version is the right one, developers do not ever tell... You should guess + test.)_  
 _(Maybe some day someone will delete this 2 lines and tell this secret, or start version-numbering)_  
  
# Install  
  
Auto-installer BAT files are in the **Lib** directory.  
  
There is a new version 1.1.1 too, but currently under development.  
Many reported it is stable enough.  
You may download the source [from here.](https://github.com/IndySockets/Indy/pull/299)
